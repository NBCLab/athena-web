ATHENA is a tool for classifying cognitive neuroscience studies according to the Cognitive Paradigm Ontology (CogPO).

# The Problem
Manually annotating neuroimaging papers is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With >40,000 studies in the literature, manual annotation is intractable.

# Our Solution
Using preexisting annotations and the text from associated articles, we are training classifiers to predict CogPO labels based on article text.

# Funding
ATHENA is funded via [NSF Grant 1631325](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1631325).
